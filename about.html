            <p class="about-text">
                As a Master of Architecture student at the University of California, Berkeley, I am passionate about exploring the intersections of architecture, digital fabrication, and interdisciplinary practice. I have a Bachelor's degree in architecture from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my previous work at Reform Architecture Firm, I contributed to the parametric facade design of a large-scale complex and standardized industrial production using Grasshopper. During my internship at META Architecture Firm, I gained a clear understanding of the entire process from bidding for projects to their implementation within a small team. My focus lies in the realm of digital construction in architecture, including programming robots to spray polymer materials on membrane structures. I have also won multiple awards in international competitions, such as the "Regeneration" Architecture Heritage Preservation Competition and YAC Design Competition.
